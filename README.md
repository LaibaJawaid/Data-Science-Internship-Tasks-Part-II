## Completed Tasks

###  Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

- Performed **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, normalization, feature selection).
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on purchasing patterns.  
- Evaluated clustering performance using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
- Visualized customer groups in **2D/3D scatter plots** to show clear separations between clusters.
- Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize the clusters (Dimensionality reduction) 
- Derived insights on customer behavior → identified **high-value customers, discount-sensitive groups, and frequent buyers**.

- Suggested relevant marketing strategies for each identified segment at the end with Summary insights!

### Task 3: Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

- Conducted **time series analysis** on energy consumption dataset.  
- Performed **trend, seasonality, and residual decomposition** to understand patterns.
- Parsed and resampled the time series data into weekdays, months and years.
- Built forecasting models:  
  - **ARIMA/ PROPHET/ XGBOOST** for capturing temporal dependencies.  
  - Compared results with other models with the help of evaluation like **MAE & RMSE**.  
- Visualized actual vs predicted values to highlight forecasting accuracy.
- Visualization of Forecasts vs. Actuals
- Choosing Best Model for Analysis

- Derived insights on **peak demand periods** and potential optimization strategies.
- Time series forecasting & Temporal data visualization.

### Task 5: Interactive Business Dashboard in Streamlit

 Designed a **dynamic Streamlit dashboard** for Global Superstore dataset.  
- Added **sidebar filters** for interactive data exploration & Built key **KPI cards**.  
- Developed multiple interactive visualizations using **Plotly**:  
  - **Top 5 Customers by Sales** → Horizontal bar chart with color scale.  
  - **Segment-wise Sales & Profit** → Grouped bar chart.  
  - **Sales & Profit by Region** → Comparative bar chart.  
  - **Sales Trend Over Time** → Line chart with markers and smoothed trend.   
- Final dashboard provides an **end-to-end BI solution** for business decision-making.

- Finally Streamlit Application Development:
  - Page Configuration                   - Data Loading and Caching
  - Dashboard Layout                     - Filters and Widgets
  - Visualization Implementation         - Display Key Metrics
  
- Deployment from GitHub account:
Once the dashboard is developed, it can be deployed to a platform like Streamlit Cloud or a web server to make it accessible to a wider audience. This usually involves creating a 'requirements.txt' file listing all dependencies also created a '.devcontainer' file for use of development containers in a smooth environment.

## Insights & Learnings

Through these internship tasks, I gained valuable hands-on experience in applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Key learnings include:
- Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical data, parsing and resampling, and scaling features before modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Model Building & Evaluation – training classification and regression models, interpreting results through metrics like       accuracy, MAE, RMSE, and confusion matrices.
- Feature Engineering – identifying and selecting important features that improve model performance.
- Real-World Applications – predicting loan approvals, insurance costs, customer churn, and more.
- Gained practical experience with **unsupervised learning (K-Means)** and **time series models (ARIMA, PROPHET & XGBOOST)**.  
- Improved ability to extract **business insights** from raw data by using **interactive dashboards**.
- Making apps on Streamlit & deploying the application to a cloud platform like Streamlit Community Cloud.
- Tools & Workflow – improving my proficiency in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook for end-to-end data projects.

This internship has strengthened my problem-solving skills, improved my ability to work with diverse datasets, and enhanced my confidence in implementing ML solutions from scratch.
